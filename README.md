# In Your Hertz

### Audio frequency generator, from 1 to 20000 Hz.

You can play any frequency you want, in a range between 1 and 20000 Hz: just use the slider or write a frequency, then press the **play** button and the tone will play!  
You can also switch the volume and change the wave type, with one click only.
